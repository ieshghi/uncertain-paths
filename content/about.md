Hello! 

My name is **Iraj Eshghi**, I recently got my PhD from New York University's [physics department](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/physics.html). You can find the current version of my thesis [here](/thesis/thesis.pdf).

This is the site on which I will be posting my professional writings on biophysics, but also where I intend to write on whatever topics I am currently thinking about. 
In principle, I would like this to serve as a venue for me to [learn in public](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Learning+in+public), and hopefully my partially digested thoughts will help others learn as well.

I have been cursed with curiosity, and as a result you should expect to find writings on a variety of topics on the [blog](/post). Ideally, this will range from [popular science](https://softbites.org/author/ieshghi/), to [organizing and politics](https://magazine.scienceforthepeople.org/labor-special-issue/power-struggles/), with bits of social theory, literature, and whatever hobbies I may be losing myself into along the way.

I aim to follow the guidelines set out by my friend Goerge Orwell in his essay [Politics and the English Language](https://faculty.washington.edu/rsoder/EDLPS579/HonorsOrwellPoliticsEnglishLanguage.pdf), but most importantly I aim to follow his last guideline:
> Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

You can find publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DnLtmq0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Orcid](https://orcid.org/my-orcid?orcid=0000-0002-4527-7578) accounts, and (some of my) code on my [Github](https://github.com/ieshghi).
