# Overview

I heard about Kohei Saito's work starting in a disappointingly liberal place, his [interview](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/28/a-greener-marx-kohei-saito-on-connecting-communism-with-the-climate-crisis) with the Guardian back in February of 2023. His research is focused on an ecological reading of Marx's work, which he claims is a rich area which has been ignored by most Marxist thought throughout the 20th century. To do this, he drew upon the now-finished [*Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe (MEGA)*](https://mega.bbaw.de/de/projektbeschreibung), which is a complete archive of all of Marx and Engels' writings, both published and unpublished.

Saito's claim is that the late Marx actually wrote quite a bit about the interactions of society and nature, writings which are relevant to any ecological critique of capitalism. His claim is that these writings support an *ontoligically monist* view of nature and society (a.k.a nature and society are aspects of the same whole), while also prescribing a *methodological dualism* (we must analyze them separately). The interaction between the two is described by Marx's concept of *metabolism*, which Saito then compares to parallel concepts of metabolism in the writings of later Western Marxists, specifically Lukács and his student Mészáros. 

Saito shows quite conclusively that Marx's thoughts on ecology were suppressed by Orthodox Marxists in the 20th century, because these writers relied on Engels' writings and his final versions of Marx's manuscripts, which Saito believes to be unrepresentative of Marx's original thought. Specifically, Engels treated nature and society as one and the same, analytically hitting them with the same hammer of the materialist dialectic. This leads to the usual ideological kooky beliefs we see come out of the USSR, basically imposing the primacy of the dialectic over any natural law inferred from empirical measurements. Saito argues that this leads to the ecological disasters seen in Socialist states in the 20th century, as the dialectical needs of world-historical progress are seen as trumping any needs of the natural ecosystem.

## Metabolism

The most important takeaway from part I, other than historical and archival context, is the overview of Marx's theory of metabolism, as well as its counterpart in Lukács' work. 

Metabolism is the set of processes by which society appropriates and consumes parts of nature before excreting it back. This can be maintained in a steady-state simply by balancing out how much one takes from nature with how much is put back in.

However, under capitalism, the constant need for growth and profit forces society to take in more than nature can take back. This leads to a gradual *metabolic rift*, which leads to ecological crisis once it grows sufficiently. 

The typical example Marx drew from is the depletion of the soil. In the diagram above, we see that the "country" takes from nature what it needs, in this case growing agricultural products in the soil which slowly deplete it of nutrients. The country dwellers, then, traditionally recuperate the resulting waste from the consumption of these products (in the form of fertilizer, for example) and put it back in the soil, closing the loop. 

Under capitalism, a second arrow develops which represents the extraction of excess materials to feed the productive forces in the towns, which are needed for industry and growth. In the absence of conscientious recuperation of that resulting waste, the excess gets dumped into *the void* (more realistically, think of the mountains of human waste which used to be dumped into the Thames). This rift develops independently of the fact that the waste also *damages* the environment in which humans exist. 

## The role of labor

It is worth noting the key role that *labor* plays in this process. Labor is the vehicle through which all of these transfers are performed. Therefore, the metabolism between society and nature determines the nature of labor. One of Marx (and later, Lukács)'s particular insights into this is that the determination of labor as the intermediary between nature and society, increasingly becomes more defined by socitety over time, as the means of production take on increasingly complex forms.

The final insight which I found particularly interesting in Lukács' work, is slightly unrelated to the ecological consequences of human labor. Rather, Lukács develops the methodologically dualist approach to the nature/society relationship, to a point where it brings insights into the ontology of science itself. Indeed, he makes a distinction between the role of *labor*, which mediates between nature and society in a material way, and the role of intellectual labor, specifically empirical science, which seeks to develop humankind's *knowledge of nature*. In principle, it is possible for labor to be purely determined by the natural context. However, our knowledge of nature, or intellectual labor relating to nature, is an entirely socially constructed process. This is very important when we consider the epistemology behind how we even do science: even though the phenomena we seek to identify are natural and "objective", the process by which we study those is a product of social forces. Therefore, Lukács argues, the "contemplative" position that scientists take in their writing is actually dishonest: we cannot be purely contemplating nature, we are performing a socially constructed act by behaving as scientists. This implies all sorts of biases and cognitive traps, which scientists should be aware of rather than ignore.
