On April 28th, 2023 I defended my PhD thesis in front of my committee and a beautiful audience filled with friends and colleagues. Two of my committee members were unfortunately unable to attend in-person, but they also happened to be the ones with the most interesting questions. 

## Celebration through rumination

The thesis has 6 research chapters, but I presented only two at the defense. One of these is still not published and so I won't discuss it here, but the second chapter I presented is now available on arXiv [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01052). I got some interesting questions about it. In this post I'll discuss one in particular and some consequences it has for future research. Obviously I can't repeat the question verbatim as this happened a few days ago and my mind was on fire at the time, but it was something like

> In this model you present a continuous, large-scale description of chromatin which is agnostic to molecular details of the underlying polymer chain. In what ways could you modify your description to better approximate small-scale features such as histone modifications, for example?

This is the best kind of question to ask a theorist because one of the most important and difficult parts of theoretical modeling is remembering to connect your work to empirical reality. Many of us fail to do this. So how do I connect the model in the paper to what we know about the microscopics of the chromatin polymer? In the work we describe the state of the polymer with three smooth fields: a density field $\phi(x)$ and a velocity field $\vec v^p(x)$, how could we account for local chemical/structual changes in the polymer? 

The first part of the answer is not too hard to imagine: we can consider the fully nonlinear regime where density fluctuations are strong, which is true of the local organization of chromatin. We could also give the active sources in the model some spatial variation in the force they exert, to emulate the active/inactive regions of chromatin. Finally we can model the viscosity of the polymer more precisely, adding scale dependence or "nonlocality". Of course the resulting model wouldn't be analytically tractable, but we could put it into a computer.

The second part of the answer is a bit more subtle, but it's particularly interesting. We can keep track of the local nematic alignment of the polymer through a nematic order parameter tensor $Q_{ij}(x)$. This tensor should couple to the local alignment of forces as well as the velocity fields of polymer and solvent, and as a result should have interesting dynamics. This would give the model a continuous field to keep track of some local structural properties of the chromatin fiber, which should be comparable to birefringence measurements for example. What would the coupling of $Q$ to our fields of interest be, though, is still murky...

## Ciao, NYU physics

All of that said, I was really happy with how the defense went. It was a good culmination to a hard fought 6 years of PhD, which was the ending to a long 10 year stint in the NYU physics department. I am sad to see it go, but happy to be going towards new horizons. Thanks to my committee, my friends, my collaborators, and everyone else.
