This past weekend, I've been re-reading Chapter 1 of Gravity's Rainbow (GR) by Thomas Pynchon. I read it last winter and decided it was my favorite book, and upon returning to it I'm sticking to that statement. Going through the first episodes with the reader's companion means I've begun to actually maybe scratch the surface of this book, and every minute spent doing so brings immense pleasure. Thanks Thomas.
