This past weekend, I've been re-reading Chapter 1 of Gravity's Rainbow (GR) by Thomas Pynchon. I read it last winter and decided it was my favorite book, and upon returning to it I'm sticking to that statement. Going through the first episodes with the reader's companion means I've begun to actually maybe scratch the surface of the novel. Every minute spent doing so brings immense pleasure. Thanks Thomas.

Besides the cover photo for this post, I also made this drawing below. I hope these pictures successfully reflect how seriously and deeply I have been thinking about GR.
