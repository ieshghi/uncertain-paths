Today I got dinner (at a great south Indian [place](https://goo.gl/maps/ot8eu9KDxZqTDvMj9)) with my friend Daniel Young, who [thinks about Marx and alienation for a living](https://danielbrinkerhoffyoung.com/research/). I wanted to run some things by him, which I have had trouble processing during my recent [reading](https://ieshghi.github.io/uncertain-paths/post/05-02-2023-marx-anthro/) of secondary Marx literature. As I've made my way further into Saito's work I've been encountering questions about foundational Marxist theory that I'm not sure I actually quite understand. We had a productive conversation which is leading me to want to read other things (it's a curse, see below). We talked about nature / society, growth and productivity, but really we ended up spending quite some time on the labor theory of value. Here's what I can recall... 

## Overview of The Labor Theory of Value (LTV)

Marx's LTV is one of those concepts which is simultaneously central to his work (it's one of the first things introduced in Capital) while also being quite outdated and strictly speaking, probably not the most useful way to define value in the modern world. It's Marx's account of how commodities acquire value under capitalism. Loosely speaking, what serves as a uniting measure of value between otherwise completely distinct commodities (what decides that a pair of socks and a bunch of bananas both cost $\sim 5 \$ $?) is the amount of human labor that has gone into getting them there. Further, Marx divides the labor going into producing a commodity into necessary labor time (the time needed to produce enough value to continue surviving) and surplus labor time (any time spent working over the necessary amount). The difference between these two is otherwise known as PROFIT!!!. That's a very basic description of his account for why capitalist growth necessitates exploitation (to make profit you have to make someone work more than they're being paid for). When I first saw this in Marx I thought it was a really neat concept. Sadly though it's not always the most effective way to conceptualize value..

## LTV has some issues

Obviously LTV is in disagreement with the conventional economic concept of price, since in a market economy the price of a commodity is set by the collective uncoordinated actions of all members of the market who negotiate prices until they reach an equilibrium. Such a conception is fundamentally different from Marx's, since in it price gains a subjective character (although my statistical-mechanics-addled mind does want to argue that in many systems the average behavior of many uncoordinated actors gives you pretty *objective* measurements of the system, think for example of how random walkers in a markov chain can successfully sample really complex "objective" distributions). The market conception of price means that trends and fashions can affect price just as much as the material underpinnings of the economy can. And since Marx's theory is there to describe capitalism, it must be able to account for this. He gets away with it by differentiating *price* with *value*. But still, this is a bit slippery since in the real conditions experienced by the working class under capitalism, it is the price of the commodities they need which affect them, not its inherent value.

Another context in which I was led to question LTV was when I was reading Piketty's [Capital in the 21st Century](https://dowbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/14Thomas-Piketty.pdf) last year. In it he makes a point regarding the role of investments in the economy, and how rates of return on capital exist because capital "works" by providing infrastructure and machines, etc. This is also directly inconsistent with LTV, since the latter is fundamentally about *human labor*. Marx must have been thinking about automation in his work, so how are rates of return on capital accounted for in Marxist theory? (I am not going to talk about the Tendency of Rate of Profit to Fall here, that's one for a different post)

*Addendum, added July 2023:* I have since learned a bit more about this. G.A. Cohen, in *Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence* makes a distinction which is useful to elucidate the above. He warns the reader not to confuse the form of an economic structure with its content. More specifically, he warns that we should not conflate capital with means of production, as I did in the paragraph above. In general, it is necessary to provide machines and materials for any work to be performed, but it is *only under capitalism* that these necessary means of production take the form of capital, which is just frozen excess labor time. So in fact Piketty's account above is consistent with LTV, provided we remember that "investments" are only a meaningful form for means of production to take under a specific state of organization of the economy, namely capitalism. 

## Automation

*A totally fictional exchange loosely representing a piece of conversation:*

> I: "So consider a factory where everything has been automated. I have robots everywhere on the factory floor, raw materials come in (say, lumber) and manufactured goods go out (chairs?). According to Marx I would make $0$ profit, since at no stage in the process is any human labor power used to increase the value of any one item. But obviously I would sell the chairs for more than the lumber that went in, and provided the robots and equipment cost less to maintain than the wages of humans that would have done those jobs, I would make even more profit than if I employed workers! In an LTV framework, how could you explain that?"

> D: "First of all, there is no situation where *all* of the labor at a firm is automated. Even if the shop floor is all robots, there will at least be some kind of management which is hired. In such a scenario then, the machinery is just massively amplifying the amount of value a specific employee generates in a certain amount of work. That just means that the employee being paid a day's wages for this work is being exploited to a far more extreme degree. In this example, that would be the single manager employed to oversee the factory."

That reminded me of this graph

And also brings me to the concept of exploitation. One of the reasons I was afraid of dropping LTV was that I figured that it is a necessary component to construct Marx's theory of exploitation: exploitation is the difference between necessary labor time and surplus labor time, that's it. With some thinking and only a small amount of rephrasing however, it becomes clear that you don't need it, exploitation is too fundamental an aspect of capitalism. But also, the exchange above raises questions in and of themselves: in what sense is the single manager in this automated factory exploited? Does it make sense, in such a scenario, to imagine the "working class" as the "revolutionary class" which should establish a "dictatorship of the proletariat"? This all brought us to a discussion of the [Critique of the Gotha Program](#critique-of-the-gotha-program), which I go over further down.

## Exploitation 

Exploitation is one of the most easily misunderstood concepts in Marxist theory, mostly because the way we use it in common speech is very different with the Marxist understanding of exploitation. The conventional description of it using LTV is as I mentioned above: exploitation is when the worker is paid less than the value their labor adds to the commodity being sold. This is in contrast to the conventional understanding of exploitation which is simply "when your boss treats you poorly". In a Marxist framework, no matter how nice your office is or how friendly and caring your boss is, if the company you work with sells the product of one hour of your labor for more than your hourly wage, you are being exploited. This naturally leads to the conclusion that all profits come from exploitation, which is a cornerstone of the Marxist understanding of how capitalism leads to inequality and poor working conditions: the profit incentive leads to a maximization of exploitation, which for a variety of reasons (discussed below) is bad for workers. 

If one gets rid of LTV, say, by identifying the value of an item with its market price, then this might create a problem for a Marxist arguing that workers are exploited under capitalism. How do we save exploitation from the collapse of LTV? Here Daniel pointed me to G. A. Cohen's work, specifically his paper [The Labor Theory of Value and the Concept of Exploitation](https://e-tcs.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cohen-exploitation-and-theory-of-value.pdf) (1979). This paper, upon my quick scrolling through it, seems to address a lot of the difficulties around the LTV - exploitation question. In it, he makes the argument (among many others) that exploitation can in fact be defined in a way which is consistent with a market definition of value as price (or *equilibrium price* as he calls it). 

> Now Marxists allege that the labor theory of value is required to uncover the exploitation of the wage worker, but I disagree. What is needed is not the false and irrelevant labor theory, but the mere concept of value, as defined, independently of the labor theory, in our sentence (2) [Value determines equilibrium price]. It enables us to say that, whatever may be responsible for magnitudes of value, the worker does not receive all of the value of his product.

Although I find this quite satisfying, I did find a [blog post](https://medium.com/genus-specious/g-a-cohen-on-marx-on-exploitation-e90f12d9950a) which makes an interesting argument against this view by arguing that Cohen is assuming the equilibrium value of the commodity does not change between when it is produced by the laborer and "sold" to the boss for a day's wages, and when the boss ensuingly sells it on the market. This critique is compelling but my (layman's) impression is that to understand exploitation and whether Cohen's definition meets our needs, we must revisit why exploitation is even an interesting phenomenon to begin with.

Why is Marx's obtuse definition of exploitation useful? For it to have any value it must reveal something about capitalism. In the context of a social critique of capitalism, it should reveal a moral truth about it. My loose understanding is that at the end of the day Marx (and along with him Hegel and many others) is interested in a morality which promotes human freedom. The reason exploitation as he defines it is bad, is because it creates a situation where the boss has a form of domination over the worker. Both in the LTV framework and in Cohen's, it's clear that if the worker was not dependent on the capitalist (via machines, or certifications, or access to a market in which to sell goods, or the capital to buy raw materials) he would gladly sell his wares at the *full* market price. This unbalanced position where the worker lacks levarage over the capitalist, is a moral failing of the capitalist production process, and Cohen's formulation successfully captures this as well as LTV does. What's more, his does it without requiring that all value is derived from human labor-time. In this sense, exploitation is a very general category of relationships which all require domination and control. 

## *Critique of the Gotha Program* and workerism

All of this talk of LTV and automation and exploitation brought us to the topic of "workerism", as one of the major failures of some forms of socialist discourse. Loosely speaking workerism is a tendency some socialists have to identify too closely the well-being of society at large with the well-being of workers specifically. 

This isn't entirely ill-guided. Marx does argue that the urban working class (proletariat) is the *revolutionary class* under capitalism: profit would be impossible if workers were not exploited, and as such workers bear the brunt of the control and domination exerted by the capitalist class to maximize their profit. The capitalists also need to convert as much of society as possible into profit-generating "factories", expanding capitalist domination and exploitation into as many parts of society as possible (maybe worth reading Foucault's [Discipline and Punish](https://archive.org/details/disciplinepunish0000fouc_j5k6/page/n5/mode/2up) with this lens in mind, actually). By doing this, the capitalists "dig their own graves" by giving the working class increasing amounts of power (the economy becomes more vulnerable to strikes) and simply growing their numbers. 

From this, it's easy to imagine how syndicalist folks derive their plan for how to bring about socialism: organize massive general strikes and take over ownership of the means of production. If everyone is part of the proletariat at this late stage of capitalist development, then simply overturning the hierarchy in the workplace will give the people economic democracy, and by building a cross-syndicate democratic cooperative network one could envision a form of socialism developing. But this story is seriously lacking in a few places.

First of all, it is problematic to identify the ability to perform labor (and thus produce value) with the right to a democratic voice. While some bits of Marx like to advocate for a "dictatorship of the proletariat", I would hope this was a more abstract statement to describe democracy by the majority, and to show some kind of symmetry between the stages of history. But if we are to get rid of domination, it is important not to fall in the same trap by just putting workers in power. What about the elderly, children, students, the unemployed, those who are not able-bodied? Socialism is to aim for a situation where *everyone's needs are met*, not some kind of domineering worker-state (**cough cough**). Finally putting *work* at the center of any kind of democratic system seems foolish, since (at least in my understanding) part of the socialist project is to encourage leisure, especially with the advent of automation. Returning to the example of the fully automated factory above, in such a world if the "workers took power", this would mean that a small number of factory managers would gain ownership of massive fleets of producer-robots, and then they would control all production in the economy. That seems like a bad situation.

This whole discussion had Daniel point out to me that Marx addressed a lot of these concerns in his [Critique of the Gotha Program](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/Marx_Critque_of_the_Gotha_Programme.pdf). This is the document where he gives the aspirational goal of a socialist project: "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!". 

Finally I did want to point out another fallacy in the workerist account of revolution, which Kohei Saito discusses at length in Part II of "Marx in the Anthropocene" (post on this will likely come soon). Marx has a detailed account of the process by which capitalism "subsumes" production to maximize profit. In early stages of capitalist takeover of an industry, the latter is just "formally subsumed", basically the production lines and roles of the workers remain intact, but wages are set by the boss who as a result makes a profit. Over time though, a process takes place of "reals subsumption", where the labor process is divided into small tasks, expertise is dissolved as much as possible, and the methods of production are set up in such a way to maximize top-down control and profit, while minimizing agency and expertise for the individual workers, thus reducing their power and increasing their alienation from the labor process and the commodities they make. Think of the transition between being an employee at a small "mom-n-pop shop" and becoming a worker at a Wal-Mart. As a result, a well-subsumed firm couldn't just be "taken over" by a union and just "run by the workers", because by design it is made for top-down hierarchical control. This, Saito argues, is one of the reasons that 20th century Socialism failed.
