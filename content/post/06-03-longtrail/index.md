Tomorrow I am leaving on an expedition in the state of Vermont. My roommate and I are setting out to walk the [Long Trail](https://www.greenmountainclub.org/the-long-trail/) in one through-hike, aiming to complete it in approximately three weeks.

The preparation for this was significant, specifically packing enough food for 4-5 day segments and mailing it in advance, as well as figuring out the relatively minimal loadout we can afford to bring given the bulk of food that needs to be carried. After settling on some ultra-light equipment I successfully got my pack (with food & water) down to 33 lbs, which was the maximal amount I was going to allow myself.

Now all that remains is to actually do the hike! I aim to keep notes throughout, and perhaps if the time permits I will transcribe them for this blog.
