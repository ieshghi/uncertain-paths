# Taking a breather

Today marks the end of the free-est two months I have had, probably, in my entire adult life thus far. After finishing graduate school in May, I allowed myself a few months before starting the next phase in my career. In these two months then, I tried as hard as I could to allow my brain to cleanse itself, letting it take me in whatever direction seemed most interesting at any given time. I dove head-first into some Marxist reading I'd been meaning to do for a long time (my posts on Kohei Saito should be relevant here, and there will be a new post coming soon on G.A. Cohen). Music made its way back into my life, which has been a huge change for me. I spend many days hiking in Vermont, and then camping on a friend's land on the island of Vinalhaven in Maine.

In the middle of all this, I managed to also squeeze in some dancing, some beach time, and much quality time with the many lovely people who make this life worth living. It has been a wonderful time.

# The next step

This break is coming to an end, though. Tomorrow I begin a new period in my life, the feared Postdoc. It's somewhat surprising that I ended up here, I spent many years in grad school waffling between whether or not I wanted to pursue academic research as a career path. Nevertheless, as I am writing this I am 10 hours away from the ostensible start of my postdoctoral career. 

I will be working at the New York Genome Center (NYGC), in the labs of Profs. [Marcin Imielinski](https://www.mskilab.org/) and [Gamze Gursoy](https://g2lab.org), where I will be studying the three-dimensional organization of the genome. Even though I have been studying the physics of the genome for a long while now, I have never done so in such close proximity to the behemoth that is biomedical research. It's going to be an adjustment, and I'll probably have to learn a lot more about cancer. I'm really excited!
