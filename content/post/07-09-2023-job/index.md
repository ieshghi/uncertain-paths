# Taking a breather

Today marks the end of the free-est two months I have had in my adult life thus far. After finishing graduate school in May, I allowed myself a break before starting the next phase in my career. During this time, I allowed my brain to cleanse itself, letting it take me in whatever direction seemed most interesting on any given day. I dove head-first into some Marxist reading I'd been meaning to get to for a while (my posts on Kohei Saito should be relevant here, and there will be a new post coming soon on G.A. Cohen). Music made its way back into my life: I found myself looking forward to practicing, which has not happened in many years. I did a fair bit of hiking in Vermont, and then camped on a friend's land on an island off the coast of Maine. Many lobsters and clams were eaten, as is tradition.

In the middle of all this, I managed to squeeze in many evenings spent with the lovely people who make this life worth living. It is always fruitful to dedicate time to appreciating one's community: I would be nothing without them.

# The next step

This break is coming to an end, though. Tomorrow I begin a new period in my life, the feared Postdoc. It's somewhat surprising that I ended up here, as I spent many years in grad school waffling between whether or not I wanted to pursue academic research. Nevertheless, as I am writing this I am 10 hours away from the ostensible start of my postdoctoral career. 

I will be working at the New York Genome Center (NYGC), in the labs of Profs. [Marcin Imielinski](https://www.mskilab.org/) and [Gamze Gursoy](https://g2lab.org), where I will be studying the three-dimensional organization of the genome. Even though I have been studying the physics of the genome for a long while now, I have never done so in such close proximity to the behemoth that is biomedical research. It's going to be an adjustment, and I'll probably have to learn a lot more about cancer. I'm really excited!
